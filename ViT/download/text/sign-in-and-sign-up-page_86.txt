Background: The background features a gradient of purple and blue colors, creating a vibrant and modern look.
Layout: There are two main sections—sign-in on the left and sign-up on the right.
Text Fields: Both screens have white text fields for entering user information such as email and password.
Buttons: The sign-in and sign-up actions are highlighted with green buttons.
Font: The text is displayed in a sans-serif typeface, which is modern and readable, with the font color being white for contrast against the gradient background.
