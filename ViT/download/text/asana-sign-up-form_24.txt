Title: Asana sign up form
Text: Overall Layout: The image is a screenshot of the Asana website’s sign-up page. The background of the webpage is gradient, transitioning from a dark blue at the top to a lighter shade as it goes down. The Asana logo and navigation options like “Get Started for FREE” and “Log In” are visible at the top right corner. There’s an advertisement banner at the very top, indicating new features with custom fields. A large text in white font reads “Move work forward” against the gradient background. Below this text, there’s another line that explains that Asana is an easy way for teams to track their work and get results. At the bottom of the image, there’s a colorful triangle which seems like part of some graphic design on the webpage.
Form: In the center, there’s a “Sign Up” pop-up window asking users to use their work email address to connect with their team in Asana. Users have options to sign up using Google or by entering their email address manually.
