Overall design:
The overall design of the page is simple and straightforward. The use of white, green, and blue creates a sense of freshness and vitality. The large green "Sign Up" button on the right side of the page is the main call to action and it is easy to find and tap.
The typography is also well-chosen. The heading text is large and bold, making it easy to read. The placeholder text in the input fields is smaller and lighter, but it is still easy to read and understand.
Overall, the page is well-designed and easy to use. The use of white, green, and blue is effective in creating a visually appealing and engaging screen.
