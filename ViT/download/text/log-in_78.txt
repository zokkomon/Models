Title: log-in
Text: Left Section: The left side of the image has a white background. It contains the heading “Welcome to Catch!” in a larger, bold, black font. Below the heading, there’s a smaller black text that says “Log in to earn badges for your certification.” There’s also a teal-colored, outlined hexagonal icon.
Right Section: The right side of the image has a dark grey background. It contains a login form titled “Log In” in white text. The form has fields for ‘Username’ and ‘Password’, a ‘Remember Me’ checkbox, and buttons for ‘Forgot Password?’ and ‘Log In’, all in white text and teal accents. There’s also an option to sign up or create a new Catch account in smaller white text.
Color and Font Styles: The image uses a simple and clean color scheme with white, black, and teal as the primary colors. The font used is modern and easy to read, with important headings in bold for emphasis. The teal color is used for accents and to highlight important elements like the login button and the hexagonal icon.
Placement: The image is divided into two sections. The welcoming text and the hexagonal icon are placed on the left, while the login form and related options are placed on the right. This layout provides a clear separation between the welcoming message and the login form.
